- **Title**: Gamification of Volunteering Experience in Non-Professional Healthcare Setting and its Effects on Volunteer Engagement and Retention.
- **Introduction:**
  Non-professional healthcare volunteers, including community first responders and first aiders, play a crucial role in healthcare systems worldwide. They provide essential services that enhance community health, reduce healthcare costs and can support professional healthcare provision. The positive effects of such schemes are well understood [1]. However, the ability to deliver such services depends on volunteer engagement and retention, which are in decline [2]. We know that volunteer turnover can be improved with recognition, open communication and relationship building [3], but the ways to achieve it are yet to be extensively explored in the healthcare context.
  
  There is evidence of decreasing volunteerism participation, especially in environments which require specialist training and continuous re-certification [2]. The reasons for that are complex, but one aspect might be that younger generations entering the workforce have shown a greater need to see how they individually impact their organisation's goals instantly [4][5].
  
  Gamification is the practice of taking elements from game design and applying them to non-gaming contexts. It has been successfully used in various settings. It can be tailored to individual needs, used to communicate impact and drive engagement, improve motivation and performance [6]. However, its applicability in the healthcare environment, which demands a high degree of governance, remains underexplored [7].
- **Research Questions:**
	- Can gamification, a predominantly digital experience, influence volunteer behaviour in a non-professional healthcare setting where activities are primarily non-digital?
	- Can gamification be implemented safely and effectively to improve engagement and retention among non-professional healthcare volunteers?
	- Can gamification of volunteering experience help with the engagement and retention of future generations of volunteers?
- **Significance:**
  These are essential questions to answer. With an ageing population, the demands on the NHS will only increase. An effective volunteer workforce can help meet that demand, but it will only be as successful as our ability to engage and retain the volunteers. The success of gamification in other fields offers a potential solution. However, the existing studies cover use cases in settings without the need for strict clinical governance and might not be directly applicable. Further research is needed to understand gamification's effectiveness, challenges and benefits in such an environment.
  
  Furthermore, over time our use of technology changes our expectations. Digital, gamified experiences are becoming increasingly popular and might be essential to engage future generations of volunteers.
  
  This proposal explores the potential of gamification as a novel strategy for enhancing volunteer engagement and retention. The research results will inform future policies and practices in volunteer management within the healthcare sector.

- **Notes**:
	- Currently the data is collected for clinical governance reasons and is difficult to access by individuals unless in occasional publication of aggregate for individual. Younger generations want to make individual impact on their communities (citation needed). Would it be possible to use gamified experience to offer prompt feedback?
	- Health boards have their own volunteers - would it be worth including them in some aspect?
	- It will be a change to existing volunteers, consider [[Fisher Transition Curve]]
