- **Title**: Gamification of Volunteering Experience in Non-Professional Healthcare Setting and its Effects on Volunteer Engagement and Retention.
- **Introduction:** 
  *The introduction should grab the reader's attention and introduce the main topic of your research. It should also explain why your research is important and what you hope to achieve.*
  
  Non-professional healthcare volunteers, like community first responders or first aiders, play a crucial role in healthcare systems. They provide valuable services that can significantly benefit communities and individuals while reducing the cost of healthcare provision. The positive effects of such schemes have been researched. However, the ability to deliver such services depends on volunteer engagement and retention - topics studied far less in the healthcare context.
  
  Gamification is the practice of taking elements from game design and applying them to non-game contexts. It has been increasingly used in various settings to improve engagement, motivation, and performance. However, its application in environments requiring a high level of clinical governance is yet to be extensively studied.
  
  Through my research, I will answer the question: Can gamification be safely used to improve engagement and retention in non-professional healthcare volunteering?
  
  I believe that it is a significant question. With ageing population the demands on NHS will increase and effective volunteer workforce can help meet that demand.

- **Literature review:** 
  *The literature review should summarize the existing research on your topic. It should identify the gaps in the literature and explain how your research will fill those gaps.*

- **Methods:** The methods section should describe how you will conduct your research. It should include a discussion of your research design, data collection methods, and data analysis methods.
- **Timeline and budget:** The timeline and budget should be realistic and achievable. They should take into account the time and resources required to conduct your research.
- **Significance:** The significance section should explain why your research is important. It should discuss the potential impact of your research on your field of study.
- **References:** The references should list all of the sources you consulted in your research.

- **Notes**:
	- Currently the data is collected for clinical governance reasons and is difficult to access by individuals unless in occasional publication of aggregate for individual. Younger generations want to make individual impact on their communities (citation needed). Would it be possible to use gamified experience to offer prompt feedback?
