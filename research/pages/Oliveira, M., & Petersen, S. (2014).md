- **Abstract**:
  When analyzing past and existing trends, gamification has unarguably invaded the mainstream media in a more pervasive way than serious games. In the literature, there has been a wide range of meanings for gamification, some detractors abhorring the term to others stating it encompasses everything to do with games and entertainment. This inconsistent nomenclature and undefined scope has led to the erroneous belief that gamification and serious games are synonymous. The aim of this paper is to present the distinct differences supported by case study of the use of both gamification and serious games within the same project aimed at social innovation within the neighbourhoods.
