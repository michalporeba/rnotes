  The authors' research activities connected information and communication technologies affecting teaching methods in higher education. A total of 201 respondents studying Programming 2 participated in this research. Two hypotheses were created, as well as a pre-test (ensuring that the initial condition of equality among the group members was met) and a post-test (measuring the shift of knowledge among the respondents of the same group). An analysis based on the t-test showed the presence of a statistically significant difference among the male respondents with regard to the test results. H1 hypothesis was accepted. No statistically significant difference was detected among the female respondents, so the H2 hypothesis was rejected. Our results showed that major difference have been found only in male population, which is interesting since female respondents tend to use LMS systems more often and since male respondents are more frequently in computer games activities.
