- **Abstract**:
  *Background:* Community first responders (CFRs) work voluntarily to support UK ambulance services by responding to emergencies. They are dispatched via the local 999 call centre and details of incidents in their local area are sent to their mobile phone. They have emergency equipment with them, including a defibrillator and oxygen, and attend a range of incidents, including cardiac arrests. Previous research has looked at the impact the CFR role has had on patient survival, but there is no previous research looking at the experiences of the CFRs while working in a UK ambulance service.*
  
  Method: This study involved 10 semi-structured interviews, which took place in November and December 2018. One researcher interviewed all the CFRs using a pre-defined interview schedule. The findings of the study were analysed using thematic analysis.
  
  *Results:* The main themes from the study are ‘relationships’ and ‘systems’. The sub-themes of relationships are the relationship between CFRs; the relationship between CFRs and ambulance service staff; and the relationship between CFRs and patients. The sub-themes of systems are call allocation; technology; and reflection and support.*
  
  Conclusions:* CFRs support one another and are encouraging with new starting members. Their relationships with ambulance service staff have improved since CFRs first became active, but there is still room for improvement. The calls that CFRs attend are not always within their scope of practice, but the rate of this occurring is unclear. CFRs are frustrated with the level of technology involved in their role and feel it impacts them attending incidents quickly. CFRs reported attending cardiac arrests on a regular basis and the support that they receive afterwards. Further research should use a survey approach to further explore the experiences of the CFRs based on the themes raised in this study. Using this methodology would identify if these themes are unique to the one ambulance service where this was conducted, or if they are relevant to all UK CFRs.
